# React Image Selector

A stateless image selector for React. Let's you pass in a array of available images and passes back events to let you know which one has been selected. Available as single (radio button) or multiple (checkbox) selector.

export const availableImages = [
  { src: "./assets/chinstrap.jpg", value: "chinstrap" },
  { src: "./assets/emperor.jpg", value: "emperor" },
  { src: "./assets/king.jpg", value: "king" },
  { src: "./assets/little.jpg", value: "little" },
];

export const args = {
  multiple: true,
  imageStyles: {
    maxHeight: 300,
    maxWidth: 300,
    height: 150,
    width: 150,
  },
};

export const logEvent = (evt) => {
  action(evt.type)(evt.detail);
};

export const PrimaryTemplate = ({ multiple, imageStyles }) => {
  const [selectedImageValues, setSelectedImageValues] = useState(["emperor"]);
  const [materialControls, setMaterialControls] = useState(false);
  const docsMode = window.location.search.includes("viewMode=docs");
  const SelectorControl = multiple ? Checkbox : Radio;
  const handleOnPick = (image) => {
    const newSelections = multiple
      ? calculateCurrentSelections(image, selectedImageValues)
      : [image?.value];
    setSelectedImageValues(newSelections);
    logEvent({
      type: "onPick",
      detail: { imageSelected: image, newSelections },
    });
  };
  const handleMaterialControls = () => {
    setMaterialControls(!materialControls);
  };
  return (
    <>
      <ReactImageSelector
        availableImages={availableImages}
        selectedImages={selectedImageValues}
        onPick={handleOnPick}
        imageStyles={imageStyles}
        multiple={multiple}
        SelectorControl={
          materialControls && !docsMode ? SelectorControl : undefined
        }
      />
      <div
        style={{
          fontFamily: "Helvetica Neue,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif",
          fontSize: 14,
          color: "#333333",
        }}
      >
        {!docsMode ? (
          <div>
            <div style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
              <label htmlFor="usematerial">
                <input
                  type="checkbox"
                  id="usematerial"
                  checked={materialControls}
                  onChange={handleMaterialControls}
                />
                Use Material {multiple ? "checkbox" : "radio button"} controls
              </label>
            </div>
            <div style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>
              <span style={{ fontSize: 25 }}>üí°</span> Use the Controls tab{" "}
              <span style={{ fontSize: 30 }}>üëá</span> to dynamically change
              props and see what they do to the component, and the Actions tab{" "}
              <span style={{ fontSize: 30 }}>üëá</span> to see what its returned
              to your handler function when you select images. Switch to the
              component's Docs tab <span style={{ fontSize: 30 }}>‚òù</span>
              for a fuller description of how the component works, including a code
              example.
            </div>
          </div>
        ) : null}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

## Installation and Usage

Either `npm i react-image-selector` or `yarn add react-image-selector` to install.

Import into your own React app like so:
```js
import {ReactImageSelector} from "react-image-selector";
```

## Working Example

Here's how you might call use the component in your own app
```jsx
<ReactImageSelector
  availableImages={availableImages}
  selectedImages={selectedImageValues}
  onPick={handleOnPick}
  imageStyles={imageStyles}
  multiple={multiple}
  SelectorControl={
    materialControls && !docsMode ? SelectorControl : undefined
  }
/>
```
This _is_, in fact, how it the component is being used in the Storybook story that you're reading now.  Click on the *Show Code* tab on the working example below.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default" args={args}>
    {PrimaryTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Props Table

<ArgsTable of={ReactImageSelector} />

## Props and Actions

<div style={{ fontSize: 14, color: "#333333" }}>
  <span style={{ fontSize: 25 }}>üí°</span> Switch to the Canvas Tab{" "}
  <span style={{ fontSize: 30 }}> ‚òù</span> to use the Controls feature, where
  you can dynamically change props and see what they do to the component.
</div>

You need to at least pass the `availableImages` prop (array of `ImageType`), otherwise your selector will have nothing to show üòâ !

`ImageType` is an object with two properties, `value` and `url`, both of type `String`:
```ts
export type ImageType = {
  /**
   * A string value that is assumed to be unique to this image.  It can be the file name.
   */
  value: string;
  /**
   * A URL pointing to where the image is hosted
   */
  src: string;
};
```

  The `value` can be whatever you want - an id, an file name - but it needs to be unique or bad things will happen.

### State

The selector componenent is stateless. You must pass in `selectedImages` (array of `String`) so the selector knows which images are currently selected.

### onPick Function handler

Because it's stateless, the control cannot compute what your new selected images are. You must do that yourself and pass in a new `selectedImages` prop each time.

You must use your `onPick` function handler prop for this. This handler function will a single parameter, which is the image that was just selected (i.e. clicked). This `image` parameter is of type `ImageType` again. Your function must take this value, compute the new `selectedImages` value from it, and then pass it back to the selector control as an updated problem.

#### Computing the new `selectedImages` Prop

_How_ you compute the new `selectedImages` prop is entirely up to you.

If the selector is single image selector (prop `multiple` is false or not set at all) then it's easy: the image just clicked is now your selected image!

If it's a `multiple` selector, however, it's a bit more tricky. Remember, the `image` parameter passed to your `onPick` handler function contains no other selection information.  All you know is that image has just been clicked. The selector control doesn't tell you if that click was to select a previously unselected image or to unselect a previously selected one. You'll have to track all that in your own code.

Here's some sample code to get you started:
```jsx title="Computing a new selectedImages prop"
  if (selectedImageValues.includes(valueToCheck)) {
    return selectedImageValues.filter(
      (member: string) => member !== valueToCheck
    );
  } else {
    return [...selectedImageValues, valueToCheck];
  }
```

Is a simple toggle.  If the selected value is in the array, it's removed.  If it's not in the array then it's appended to it.  The component also exports a helper function called `calculateCurrentSelections`, which uses the code above.  You can import this into your app like so:

```js
import {
  ReactImageSelector,
  calculateCurrentSelections,
} from "react-image-selector";
```

And then use it in your `onPick` function handler like so:
```js
  const handleOnPick = (image) => {
    const newSelections = multiple
      ? calculateCurrentSelections(image, selectedImageValues)√ü
      : [image?.value];
    setSelectedImageValues(newSelections);
  };
```

where `setSelectedImageValues` is from a hook that you might use to store your values.  Click on the **Show code** link on the Working Example panel above, and you see the full version of this usage.
