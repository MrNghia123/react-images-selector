# React Image Selector

A stateless image selector for React. Let's you pass in a array of available images and passes back events to let you know which one has been selected. Available as single (radio button) or multiple (checkbox) selector.

React Image Selecor is based on original work from React Image Picker https://github.com/bagongkia/react-image-picker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) added in afterwards.
